## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* How to use a Seaborn library.
* How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn.
* How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data.
* How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
